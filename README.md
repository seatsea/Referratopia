# Referratopia
A refferal link sharing website

**What is Referratopia?**

Referratopia is a website project that will allow for sharing of referral links and invitation codes in way that makes things fair for everyone submitting links.

**How will it work?**

Users will be able to input their referral links and input how many times it needs to be used until they get the maximum referral bonus (eg getting the maximum 15gb on Dropbox). The link will be then added to a pool of links. When a user comes looking for links, the website will randomly show a few links out of the pool, the link that have been used the least will be made more likely to shown. (Wheighted radomneness)

**Why is X thing done improperly**

This is a project between me and a friend of mine, we still have a lot to learn, so we might do things in not best way, but do feel free to leave in the bug report page a proposition about how that thing can be improved.
